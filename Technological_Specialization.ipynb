        "1. Creating a Dictionary to Map CPC Codes to Sectors\n",
        "The first part of the code creates a dictionary that links specific CPC (Cooperative Patent Classification) codes to their corresponding technology sectors. This dictionary is built using two lists: one containing CPC codes and the other containing sector names. By pairing each CPC code with its sector, the dictionary allows for easy lookup of the sector based on the CPC code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If you have the following lists:\n",
        "\n",
        "CPC codes: [\"A01B\", \"C07D\", \"H04L\"]\n",
        "Sectors: [\"Agriculture\", \"Chemistry\", \"Telecommunications\"]\n",
        "The dictionary will look like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "\"A01B\" maps to \"Agriculture\"\n",
        "\"C07D\" maps to \"Chemistry\"\n",
        "\"H04L\" maps to \"Telecommunications\"\n",
        "2. Mapping CPC Codes in a String to Sectors\n",
        "The next part of the code defines a function that takes a string of CPC codes (separated by a pipe |), looks up each code in the dictionary, and returns a string of the corresponding sectors (also separated by a pipe).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If the input string is \"A01B|C07D|H04L\", the function will:\n",
        "\n",
        "Look up \"A01B\" and find it maps to \"Agriculture\"\n",
        "Look up \"C07D\" and find it maps to \"Chemistry\"\n",
        "Look up \"H04L\" and find it maps to \"Telecommunications\"\n",
        "Return the string \"Agriculture|Chemistry|Telecommunications\"\n",
        "3. Applying the Sector Mapping Function\n",
        "The function from step 2 is then applied to a column in a DataFrame (which contains strings of CPC codes). This creates a new column in the DataFrame where each string of CPC codes is replaced with a string of corresponding sectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If a row in the DataFrame has the CPC string \"A01B|C07D\", after applying the function, the new column will contain \"Agriculture|Chemistry\".\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Calculating Sector Fractions\n",
        "Next, a more complex function is defined to calculate the fractional share of each sector. This function considers both the share of each CPC code (how much of the patent's focus is in that area) and the share of inventors from different countries. The function calculates how much each country contributes to each sector, based on the CPC code shares.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If a row indicates that:\n",
        "\n",
        "50% of the patent's focus is on \"A01B\" (Agriculture) and 50% on \"C07D\" (Chemistry).\n",
        "70% of the inventors are from the US and 30% from Germany.\n",
        "The function calculates:\n",
        "\n",
        "For Agriculture: US inventors contribute 35% (50% of 70%) and German inventors contribute 15% (50% of 30%).\n",
        "For Chemistry: US inventors contribute 35% and German inventors contribute 15%.\n",
        "So, the function would return:\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Agriculture:0.5000|Chemistry:0.5000\"\n",
        "5. Applying the Sector Fraction Calculation\n",
        "Finally, the function from step 4 is applied to each row in the DataFrame to compute the sector fractions based on the CPC and inventor country shares. This creates another new column in the DataFrame, showing the calculated sector fractions for each patent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If a row has:\n",
        "\n",
        "50% focus on \"A01B\" (Agriculture) and 50% on \"C07D\" (Chemistry).\n",
        "70% US inventors and 30% German inventors.\n",
        "The resulting sector fraction column will show:\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Agriculture:0.5000|Chemistry:0.5000\"\n",
        "This process allows for a detailed analysis of how different sectors are represented in the patents, taking into account both the technological focus and the geographical distribution of inventors."
